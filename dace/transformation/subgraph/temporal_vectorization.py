    This transformation applies the multi-pumping optimization to a subgraph targeting FPGAs, in turn packing more computations temporally rather than spatially as is done in traditional vectorization.

    Currently, it can only be applied to applications targeting Xilinx FPGAs, and to subgraphs that purely communicate through streams. It can be applied in two ways:
    1. Inwards - where the internal widths of the subgraph are narrowed. This gives the benefit of a reduced critical-resource footprint at the same throughput.
    2. Outwards - where the external widths of the streams are widened. This gives the benefit of increased throughput at the same critical-resource footprint.

The idea is that if the analysis becomes too hard (i.e. they are not convertible), then we could insert the packers / issuers at the cost of degraded performance / plumbing overhead, since data would then be packed, unpacked, computed, packed, unpacked. Hmm, but that wouldn't work, would it, since the initial packing is now handled in the slow clock region, essentially halving the II. One would still get the benefit of half resources, so I guess that it could make sense for certain applications.
